Blast and Rust disease detection by using CNN in Pearl Millet crop
Pearl millet, a crucial staple in semi-arid tropics and the most cultivated crop in India, plays a vital role in ensuring food security and livelihoods, especially in regions with erratic rainfall and high temperatures. However, diseases such as rust and blast pose significant threats to yield and grain quality. Traditional detection methods relying on visual inspection are subjective and prone to errors.

This project aims to revolutionize disease identification in pearl millet using advanced technology. Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), we've developed a robust system to accurately identify diseases like rust (Puccinia substriata) and blast (Pyricularia grisea) by analyzing digital images of infected leaves. Our CNN architecture, comprising convolutional, activation, pooling, and fully connected layers, efficiently extracts features and patterns from images, enabling precise disease classification.

By overcoming the limitations of conventional techniques, our CNN-based approach offers unparalleled accuracy in disease detection. Our model demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving a training accuracy of 99.89% and a testing accuracy of 99.59%. With the potential to transform disease management in pearl millet cultivation, our work contributes to enhancing food security and maximizing yields in vulnerable agricultural systems.
